# this file is for schema creation.
# add full names of the DDL or SQL files in this file, one file per row
# please note that the order is important - the DDLs will be executed in the order given here.
# do not use commas, any special symbols

# you can add comments like this one - marked with the '#' symbol, you can have empty lines - those will be ignored by the interpreter
# only lines with the first symbol a '#' will be recognised as comments. You cannot have a ddl file name followed by a # and a comment in the same line

# Example:
# create_table__order_lines.sql
# create_indexes__order_lines.sql
